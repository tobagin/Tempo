  - Connected all visual preferences to main window UI updates
  - Added support for additional audio formats (FLAC, AAC)
  - Implemented start-on-launch functionality
  - Completed custom sounds implementation:
    * Custom sounds toggle now properly shows/hides file picker rows

    * Test playback of selected sounds
    * Right-click context menu to clear custom sounds
    * External settings change synchronization

## Discovered During Work

- Blueprint UI syntax requires compilation to .ui files during build
- GStreamer timing requires separate thread with GLib.idle_add for UI updates
- Metronome timing must use absolute time references (time.perf_counter()) to avoid drift
- Flatpak audio requires explicit --socket=pulseaudio permission
- GTK4 applications should use Adw.ApplicationWindow, not Gtk.ApplicationWindow
- GTK4 FileDialog replaces deprecated FileChooserDialog with async API
- Window surface operations need to be called after window realization
- Visual preferences automatically trigger redraws through settings.changed signal
